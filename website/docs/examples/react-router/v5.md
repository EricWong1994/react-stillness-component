## React-router Route
 
This example shows the caching of `state` and `dom` respectively

where the counter in the `Home` tab is not updated due to route changes because it is quiesced.
And the list in the `list` tab will always remember the last position after scrolling, because it is also quiesced.

Of course, after clicking the **clear** button, the cache state of the counter and the list will be cleared.

## React-router Switch

This example uses the relevant features of `Switch`

:::info Title: StillnessSwitch

The `StillnessSwitch` here is based on the `withRouter` wrapper component, as stated in the brief, `react-stillness-component` is the base library, which can be combined and wrapped on it again

Because the official `switch` unloads the other routes by default, the component encapsulated here retains the match function of `switch`, but also does caching for the routes, so that each route is stillness by default, and if you want to control it yourself, you can also support it through various native capabilities, such as: `props`, compared to the original code, just do not uninstall other routes only

If you have a better idea, welcome to discuss!
